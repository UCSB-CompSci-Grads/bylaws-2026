# Update of CS GSA by-laws

This repository is created for suggesting updates to the by-laws of CS GSA of UCSB.

## Why?

The current by-laws are severely outdated and the current CS GSA cannot work under these laws due to inability to maintain all the positions (as some of them are outdated or impossible) or a requirement to use methods for voting not directly allowed in the by-laws (e.g., Google Forms). The goal is to update the by-laws to the current reality to make the CS GSA work possible-.

## Contribution

To propose your modified version of the by-laws, create a fork and propose a pull request to the main repo with your changes. Pull request should contain:
- Changed text of by-laws in the file bylaws.md
- Summary of the proposed changes and justification if needed in the comment section of the pull request.

When pull request is done, request a review from @maybe-hello-world.

## Questions and suggestions

For any questions, concerns, or suggestions, feel free to create an issue in this repository. You also can reach out to CS GSA members privately via emails specified on the gsa.cs.ucsb.edu website.
